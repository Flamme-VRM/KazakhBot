* **Roadmap:**
* 
We have exciting plans for the future of AsylBILIM, constantly striving to enhance its intelligence and utility for Kazakh students. Here are some key features and improvements we're actively working on or planning:

* **Implementing a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) System:** Our top priority is to integrate a robust RAG system. This will enable AsylBILIM to retrieve information from a curated knowledge base (e.g., educational materials, textbooks, exam guidelines specific to Kazakhstan) before generating responses. This ensures that the bot provides the most **relevant, accurate, and concise** answers, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving the factual correctness of information, especially for academic queries.

* **Acknowledgements:**
    * This bot can make mistakes, please double-check responses.
